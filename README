Factor library implementing a way to extend logically digits sequence using only copy and increment. Its possibilities are although interesting as it often returns results we didn't thought about and absolutely logical.


INSTALL FACTOR:

Visit Factor website: http://factorcode.org/, and install latest stable version.


INSTALL LIBRARY:

Copy all files and directories in a folder named 'complexity' in factor/work/


LAUNCH AND TEST:

Launch factor, either using its executable, or without its GUI using:
rlwrap ./factor -run=listener

Then enter
USE: complexity
and test it with for example:
{ 1 2 2 3 3 3 } extend-logic .


READING DOCUMENTATION:

A whole documentation has been written around this library, even for private words.
To read it, the easiest way is to click on the 'HELP' button in the GUI after having loaded 'complexity' library and search 'complexity'.
You can select complexity for main words, complexity.private for inside words, complexity.tools for useful tools (that may also be useful in other libraries), and complexity.tools.private for its inside words.
